__General Atomics, San Diego. Summer 2014.__

Developed a metric to quantify a tokamak's ability to control its plasma. Built on existing Matlab simulations of tokamaks to automate tuning of the plasma control system normally done by trial and error.

## [Aerodynamics Simulations for the D8 “Double Bubble” Aircraft Using the LAVA Unstructured Solver](d8-sim.pdf)

__NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field. Summer 2013.__

Ran fluid simulations of a wind tunnel test on NASA's Pleiades supercomputer using the new LAVA code on an unstructured mesh. Unstructured meshes, like the one shown above, can be created automatically given a model, as opposed to structured overset grids, which are usually made by hand. The D8 is a passenger aircraft concept that could take on the role of the Boeing 737 by 2035.

## [Pong](pong.pdf)

__Intro to Electrical Engineering, Columbia University. Winter 2012.__

Used two Arduinos to simulate a ball bouncing around an oscilloscope screen, and an array of LEDs hooked up to an Arduino to do the same thing.

## [Enhancing a Hydrogen PEM Fuel Cell Stack with Gold-Dodecanethiolate Core-Shell Nanoparticles](intel_au-nps.pdf)

__Garcia MRSEC program at Stony Brook University, NY. Summer 2011.__

Added a gold nanoparticle catalyst to hydrogen fuel cell membranes arranged in a stack. The stack configuration is how fuel cells are used in the real world, whereas laboratories commonly test single cells.

Intel Science Talent Search semifinalist.
