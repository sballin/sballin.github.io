_General Atomics, San Diego, Summer 2014_

Developed a metric to quantify a tokamak's ability to control its plasma. Built on existing Matlab simulations of tokamaks to automate tuning of the plasma control system normally done by trial and error.

_NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Summer 2013_

Ran fluid simulations of a wind tunnel test on NASA's Pleiades supercomputer using the new LAVA code on an unstructured mesh. Unstructured meshes, like the one shown above, can be created automatically given a model, as opposed to structured overset grids, which are usually made by hand. The D8 is a passenger aircraft concept that could take on the role of the Boeing 737 by 2035.

_Intro to Electrical Engineering, Columbia University, Winter 2012_

Used two Arduinos to simulate a ball bouncing around an oscilloscope screen, and an array of LEDs hooked up to an Arduino to do the same thing.
