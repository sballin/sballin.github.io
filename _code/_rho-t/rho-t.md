The folks at Columbia's Application Development Initiative made a tool called [Density](https://density.adicu.com) which estimates how full different places around Columbia's campus are using WiFi data. Unfortunately it only gives percentages for the moment you check the site. I wanted to see how the data changed over time.

ρ(t) scrapes data from [density.adicu.com](http://density.adicu.com/) every 15 minutes and shows it all using a D3 graph. Here's the [Github page](https://github.com/sballin/rho_t) for the project.
