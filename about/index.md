This website
------------

I made this site and the Python script that generates it for fun. The script is named Parasite, and you can check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/sballin).

Easter eggs took priority over some of the most basic features. Happy hunting!

Me
---

My name is Sean, and I'm a junior at Columbia University. I'm studying Applied Physics with a minor in Computer Science, and I want to work on projects related to nuclear fusion, aerospace engineering, and medical physics. There's already a nice [page](http://engineering.columbia.edu/sean-ballinger) with some more information about me.
