This website
------------

I made this site while playing around with CSS and Python a few years ago. I'm sure I've done some unspeakably horrible things, but I think it looks nice now. And the script that generates it from Markdown files is decent. It's all contained in this [repo](https://github.com/sballin/sballin.github.io) on GitHub.
