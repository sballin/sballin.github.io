Wouldn't it be cool if you could chat with strangers around you in a coffee shop, or even around an entire campus? A couple friends and I thought so, and we made a bluetooth chat app for Android phones during Columbia's ADI hackathon.

It's a fun proof of concept, and hopefully in the future we'll figure out some decentralized protocol like Bittorrent for phones to communicate over. This could be useful for people in disaster areas when cell towers get damaged, or in very crowded places where networks get overloaded.
