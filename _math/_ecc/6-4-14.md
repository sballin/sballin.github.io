# Elliptic Curve Cryptography

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is a form of cryptography used by most banks today. It has fewer exploits than RSA [citation needed] and is less computationally intensive for the same level of security (which is important when you have millions of clients making requests every hour). 

One day I'll finish writing about it!
