# Langton's Ant <a href="https://github.com/sballin/iterant"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a>

This is a start toward solving problem [349](http://projecteuler.net/problem=349) from Project Euler:

> An ant moves on a regular grid of squares that are coloured either black or white. The ant is always oriented in one of the cardinal directions (left, right, up or down) and moves from square to adjacent square according to the following rules:

> - if it is on a black square, it flips the color of the square to white, rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise and moves forward one square.

> - if it is on a white square, it flips the color of the square to black, rotates 90 degrees clockwise and moves forward one square.

> Starting with a grid that is entirely white, how many squares are black after $10^{18}$ moves of the ant?

I made a Mathematica simulation to find the point around which the motion of the ant stops being random and enters a "highway."

After spending a lot of time at the beginning going through seemingly random configurations, the ant reaches a configuration that makes it "repeat" the same sequence and launch into a highway.

Here's the code, which you can also find on [GitHub](https://github.com/sballin/iterant):

    (* Short-term to long-term behavior of Langton's ant. *)

    moveAnt[gridLen_, maxIts_]:=Module[{grid, antX, antY, dir, dirlist, i},
        grid = ConstantArray[0, {gridLen, gridLen}];
        antX = Floor[gridLen/2];
        antY = Floor[gridLen/2];
        dir  = -Pi/2;
        i    = 0;

        Do[
            (* if on white, make black, turn 90 deg counterclockwise *)
            If[grid[[antX, antY]] == 0,
                grid[[antX, antY]] = 1;
                dir  = dir+Pi/2;
                antX = antX+Cos[dir];
                antY = antY+Sin[dir];
            ]

            (* if on black, make white, turn 90 deg clockwise *)
            If[grid[[antX, antY]] == 1,
                grid[[antX, antY]] = 0;
                dir  = dir-Pi/2;
                antX = antX+Cos[dir];
                antY = antY+Sin[dir];
            ]
        ,{i, maxIts}];

        MatrixPlot[grid, ColorFunction -> "Monochrome"]
    ];

    (* allow scrubbing through number of iterations *)
    Manipulate[moveAnt[100, its], {{its, 0, "Iterations"}, 0, 8500,1}]
